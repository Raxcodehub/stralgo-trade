### For Human Developers

1. Read `README.md` for project overview
2. Review `COPILOT_ARCHITECTURE_PROMPT.md` to understand the complete architecture
3. Use `PROJECT_SETUP.md` as your implementation reference
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment
5. Follow the 10 implementation phases sequentially
6. Track progress using `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`

### For Project Managers

- Review `QUICKSTART_COPILOT.md` for time estimates (30-40 hours)
- Use `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` to track team progress
- Reference `COPILOT_ARCHITECTURE_PROMPT.md` for scope understanding

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Phases

The project is divided into 10 well-defined phases:

1. **Foundation Setup** (2-3 hours) - Project initialization, dependencies, configuration
2. **Core Infrastructure** (3-4 hours) - Disruptor, domain models, repositories
3. **Broker Integration** (4-5 hours) - Zerodha and Upstox API clients
4. **Market Data Pipeline** (3-4 hours) - Real-time data processing
5. **Strategy Engine** (4-5 hours) - Trading strategies and indicators
6. **Order Management** (3-4 hours) - Order lifecycle and position tracking
7. **Risk Management** (2-3 hours) - Risk limits and circuit breakers
8. **API Layer** (2-3 hours) - REST/WebSocket APIs
9. **Testing** (4-5 hours) - Unit, integration, and e2e tests
10. **Documentation & Deployment** (2-3 hours) - Final docs and deployment setup

**Total Estimated Time**: 30-40 hours

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

- ‚úÖ System connects to both Zerodha and Upstox APIs
- ‚úÖ Real-time market data processed with <100ms latency
- ‚úÖ Orders can be placed, modified, and cancelled programmatically
- ‚úÖ At least 2 working trading strategies implemented
- ‚úÖ Risk management enforced correctly
- ‚úÖ System handles API failures gracefully
- ‚úÖ Test coverage >80%
- ‚úÖ Disruptor processes >10,000 events/second
- ‚úÖ API gateway provides secure access
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging and monitoring in place

## üîê Security Considerations

All documentation emphasizes security:
- API credentials never committed to code
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers
- Audit logging for all operations

3. Update the implementation checklist as you complete items
4. Document any architectural decisions
5. Ensure all tests pass before committing

## üìû Support

For questions about:
- **Architecture**: See `COPILOT_ARCHITECTURE_PROMPT.md`
- **Setup**: See `PROJECT_SETUP.md`
- **Quick Start**: See `QUICKSTART_COPILOT.md`
- **Progress Tracking**: See `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **This is a prompt package** - The actual implementation code has not been created yet
2. **Use for education** - This is for learning; real trading involves financial risk
3. **Test thoroughly** - Always test with sandbox/paper trading before live trading
4. **Comply with regulations** - Ensure compliance with SEBI and broker regulations
5. **Secure your credentials** - Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
